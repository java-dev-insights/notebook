# Introduction to OS

First thing a computer has to do when it is turned on, is start up a special program called an operating system. 

OS’s job - To help other computer programs to work by handling the details of controlling the computer’s hardware.

### Computer Systems
- Hardware – cpu, memory, io-devices
- Softwares 
	- System Softwares – OS, Compiler, Loader. 
	- Application Software – email, ms-office, games, railway reservation system.
- Users – people, computer

***Operating system*** is an interface between user and hardware.

### Responsibilities of OS:
- Provide an environment in which user can execute programs. 
- Resource allocator
- Manager – Memory, processes, files, security etc.

### Goals of OS:
- Primary - convenience
- Secondary - efficiency

## System Boot Step Sequence

User 3
```

**Data Types** – Defines the Type of data and operations allowed on it.

# Types of Operating Systems

## Batch OS
- Jobs with similar needs batched together, run as a group.
- First come first served.

### Disadvantages
- Only after completion of job1, control is transferred to job2.
- Under-utilisation of resources.
- Lack of interaction between user and program.

## Multitasking OS
- Jobs should be executed in time sharing mode.
- Fixed time quantum to every job (Preemption).
