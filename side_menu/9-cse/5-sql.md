# Introduction

* SQL is Structured Query Language, which is a computer language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data stored in relational DB.
* SQL is the standard language for Relation Database System. 
* All Relational DBMS like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, postgres and SQL Server use SQL as standard database language.
* Also, they are using different dialects, such as:
	- MS SQL Server using T-SQL,
	- Oracle using PL/SQL,
    - MS Access version of SQL is called JET SQL (native format) etc.

Database    |Collection of logically related data
DBMS	    |Set of software or program that enables storing, modifying and extracting info from the DB
Data Model	|Representation of real-world situation aboutwhich data is to be collected and stored in DB.<br>Represents logical relationship and data flow among different data elements.

# SQL Process

* When you are executing an SQL command for any RDBMS, the system determines the best way to carry out your request and SQL engine figures out how to interpret the task.
* There are various components included in the process. These components are Query Dispatcher, Optimization Engines, Classic Query Engine and SQL Query Engine, etc. Classic query engine handles all non-SQL queries but SQL query engine won't handle logical files.

# SQL Commands

* The standard SQL commands to interact with relational databases are CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and DROP.
* **Table** - collection of related data entries as records(rows) having columns representing fields.
* ***What is NULL value?*** Aappears to be blank but is actually no value. It is different than a zero or spaces.
* These commands can be classified into groups based on their nature:

## DML-Data Manipulation Language

### CREATE
```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
USE database_name;
CREATE TABLE table_name(col1 datatype, col2 datatype) PRIMARY KEY(col1, col4);
DESC table_name;
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name ON table_name (col1,col2);
```

### TRUNCATE
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE <table_name>;
```
### DROP
```sql
DROP DATABASE database_name;
DROP TABLE <table_name>;
```

### ALTER
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name {ADD|DROP|MODIFY} column_name {data_ype};
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP INDEX index_name;
ALTER TABLE <table_name> RENAME TO <new_table_name>;
```

### INSERT
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name( column1, column2....columnN)
VALUES ( value1, value2....valueN);
```

### UPDATE
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET col1 = v1, col2 = v2 [ WHERE  CONDITION ];
```

### DELETE
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE  {CONDITION};
```

### MERGE

## TCL-Transaction Control Language	

### COMMIT

### ROLLBACK
```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

### SAVEPOINT 


## DQL-Data Query Language

### SELECT
```sql
SELECT column1, column2....columnN
FROM   table_name
WHERE  column_name IN (val-1, val-2,...val-N) 
OR column_name LIKE { AR% }
OR column_name BETWEEN val-1 AND val-2 
ORDER BY column_name {ASC|DESC};
```

## DCL-Data Control Language	

### GRANT
* Gives a privilege to user
### REVOKE
* Takes back privileges granted from user

# SQL Constraints

* Constraints are the rules enforced on data columns on table to limit the type of data that can go into a table. 
* Ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database.
* Constraints could be column level or table level.
* Following are commonly used constraints available in SQL:
	- [NOT NULL Constraint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-not-null.htm): Ensures that a column cannot have NULL value.
	- [DEFAULT Constraint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-default.htm): Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.
	- [UNIQUE Constraint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-unique.htm): Ensures that all values in a column are different.
	- [PRIMARY Key](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-primary-key.htm): Uniquely identified each rows/records in a database table.
	- [FOREIGN Key](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-foreign-key.htm): Uniquely identified a rows/records in any another database table.
	- [CHECK Constraint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-check.htm): The CHECK constraint ensures that all values in a column satisfy certain conditions.
    - [INDEX](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-index.htm): Use to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly.

### Data Integrity:
The following categories of the data integrity exist with each RDBMS:
* **Entity Integrity**: There are no duplicate rows in a table.
* **Domain Integrity**: Enforces valid entries for a given column by restricting the type, the format, or the range of values.
* **Referential integrity**: Rows cannot be deleted, which are used by other records.
* **User-Defined Integrity**: Enforces some specific business rules that do not fall into entity, domain or referential integrity.

# SQL Syntax

* SQL is followed by unique set of rules and guidelines called Syntax. 
* All the SQL statements start with any of the keywords like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, DROP, CREATE, USE, SHOW and all the statements end with a semicolon (;).
* Important point to be noted is that SQL is case insensitive, which means SELECT and select have same meaning in SQL statements, but MySQL makes difference in table names. So, if you are working with MySQL, then you need to give table names as they exist in the database.
* All the examples given in this tutorial have been tested with MySQL server.

SELECT-WHERE-AND/OR
```sql
SELECT column1, column2....columnN
FROM   table_name 
WHERE CONDITION-1 {AND|OR} CONDITION-2;
```
SQL DISTINCT Clause
```sql
SELECT 
DISTINCT column1, column2....columnN
FROM   table_name;
```
GROUP BY-HAVING
```sql
SELECT SUM(column_name)
FROM   table_name
WHERE  CONDITION
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING (arithematic function condition);
```
SQL COUNT Clause
```sql
SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM   table_name
WHERE  CONDITION;
```

<summary>You have a composite index of 3 columns, and WHERE clause has only mentioned 2 of them, Will Index be used for this operation?</summary>

---
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE EmpId=2 and EmpFirstName='Radhe'
```
* Index is on EmpId, EmpFirstName, and EmpSecondName
* If the given two columns are secondary index column then the index will not invoke, but if the given 2 columns contain the primary index(first column while creating index) then the index will invoke. In this case, Index will be used because EmpId and EmpFirstName are primary columns.

<summary>Nth highest Salary</summary>

> Read full article for [nth highest salary](https://howtodoinjava.com/sql/sql-query-find-nth-highest-salary/)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employee_Test Emp1
WHERE ( n ) = (
                SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT ( Emp2.Employee_Salary ) )
                FROM Employee_Test Emp2
                WHERE Emp2.Employee_Salary >= Emp1.Employee_Salary
            )
```

#### How the query works
* As we can see this query involves use of an inner query. Inner queries can be of two types. [**Correlated**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlated_subquery) and **uncorrelated** queries. Uncorrelated query is where inner query can run independently of outer query, and correlated query is where inner query runs in conjunction to outer query. Our ***nth highest salary*** is an example of `correlated query`.
* Lest understand first that the inner query executes every time, a row from outer query is processed. Inner query essentially does not do any very secret job, it only return the count of distinct  salaries which are higher than the currently processing row’s salary column. Anytime, it find that salary column’s value of current row from outer query, is equal to count of higher salaries from inner query, it returns the result.
 
#### Performance analysis
As we learned above that inner query executes every time, one row of outer query is processed, this brings a lot of performance overhead, specially if the number of rows are too big.
To avoid this, one should use DB specific keywords to get the result faster. For example in SQL server, one can use key word TOP like this.
```sql
SELECT TOP 1 EMPLOYEE_SALARY
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT TOP N EMPLOYEE_SALARY
    FROM EMPLOYEE_TEST
    ORDER BY EMPLOYEE_SALARY DESC
) A
ORDER BY EMPLOYEE_SALARY
WHERE N > 1

# SQL Queries

[Mathematical Functions](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/mysql-5.0-en/mathematical-functions.html)

## MEDIAN
```sql
select round(median(lat_n),4) from station;
```

# Queries
Query the greatest value of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION that is less than 137.2345 round the result to 4 places
```sql
select round(max(lat_n),4) from station where lat_n < 137.2345;
```
sum of all values in LAT_N, LONG_W rounded to a scale of 2 decimal places
```sql
select round(sum(lat_n),2), round(sum(long_w),2) from station;
```
Difference between total and distinct number of cities in station.
```sql
select count(*) - count(distinct city) from station;
```

Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than 137.2345. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.
```sql
select round(long_w,4) from station where lat_n = (select max(lat_n) from station where lat_n < 137.2345);
```

find [Manhattan Distance](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/manhattanDistance.html) between two point with longitude and latitude with min and max values as point coordinates
- distance = |x2-x1|+|y2-y1|
```sql
select round(abs(a-c)+abs(b-d),4) from (select min(lat_n) a, min(long_w) b, max(lat_n) c, max(long_w) d from station);
```

find [Eucledean Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between two points in cartesian plane
```sql
select round(sqrt(power(a-c,2)+power(b-d,2)),4) from (select min(lat_n) a, min(long_w) b, max(lat_n) c, max(long_w) d from station);
```

Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
```sql
select * from (select city, length(city) cLength from station order by cLength, city) where rownum = 1 
union 
select * from (select city, length(city) cLength from station order by cLength desc, city) where rownum = 1;
```
Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
```sql
select distinct city from station 
where substr(lower(city),1,1) in ('a','e','i','o','u')
and substr(lower(city), -1) in ('a','e','i','o','u');
```
```sql
select distinct city from station
where REGEXP_LIKE(lower(city), '^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$');
```
Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
* !a or !b --> !(a and b)
```sql
select distinct city from station
where NOT REGEXP_LIKE(lower(city), '^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$');
```


```sql
select name||'('||substr(occupation,1,1)||')' from occupations order by name;
SELECT 'There are a total of '||COUNT(OCCUPATION)||' '||LOWER(OCCUPATION)||'s.' FROM OCCUPATIONS GROUP BY OCCUPATION ORDER BY COUNT(OCCUPATION) ASC, OCCUPATION ASC;
```

### When Then Queries

query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:
- Equilateral: It's a triangle with all sides of equal length.
- Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
- Scalene: It's a triangle with all sides of differing lengths.
- Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
```sql
SELECT 
CASE 
WHEN A + B > C THEN 
    CASE
    WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
    WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
    WHEN A != B OR B != C OR A != C THEN 'Scalene' END 
ELSE 'Not A Triangle' END FROM TRIANGLES;
```

## Print Pattern

```sql
set @row := 0;
select repeat('* ', @row := @row + 1) from information_schema.tables 
where @row < 5;
-- output

* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * *
```
```sql

```

```sql
select ceil(avg(salary)-avg(replace(salary,'0','')))
from employees e;
```

grade vs marks range in grades table
```sql

        when grade <8
        THEN NULL 
        ELSE name END) name, grade, marks
from
(
    select name, grade, marks
    from students, grades
    where marks between min_Mark and Max_Mark
) gradeList
order by grade desc, name, coalesce(name,marks);
```
